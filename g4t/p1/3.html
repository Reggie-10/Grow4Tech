    <h2>2.Gulab Jamun</h2>
    <img src="./gulab jamun.JPG" alt="gulab jamun" width="200" height="200">
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup full-fat milk powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee</li>
        <li>5 to 6 tablespoons milk, as needed</li>
        <li>Oil for deep-frying</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1-1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, to prevent the sugar syrup from crystallizing</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon rose essence or 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons rose water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method of preparation:</h3>
    <h4>step 1</h4>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, add the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder and ghee.
        Slowly add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently form the dough by mixing. It should be a stiff dough. If
        the dough is sticky, grease your palms with oil and gently mix. Do not knead the dough—it will make the jamuns
        hard.</p>
    <h4>step 2</h4>
    <p>Cover the dough with a damp cloth. Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
    <h4>step 3</h4>
    <p> In a saucepan, add the sugar, water and two green cardamom pods, crushed.
        Bring the mixture to a boil and let the sugar dissolve. When the sugar is completely dissolved, simmer over
        medium-low heat for 5 to 6 minutes. We need a sticky-consistency sugar syrup here. You can test it by removing a
        small amount of sugar syrup and letting it cool a bit. Then touch the sugar syrup with your index finger and
        press it with your thumb. You should feel the stickiness.
        When it’s ready, remove the syrup from the heat and add the rose essence or rose water. Set aside.</p>
    <h4>step 4</h4>
    <p>Grease your palms and pinch a small amount of dough. Roll gently to form a small, smooth ball—to give you an idea
        of the size, I make about 20 jamuns using this recipe.</p>
    <h4>step 5</h4>
    <p>In a heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, heat a few inches of oil over low heat.
        The oil should not be very hot while frying the gulab jamuns. To test the oil, drop in a small piece of the
        dough. It will sink initially, but after 30 seconds or so, it will float up, and the color should not change.
        That’s the right temperature
        Slowly drop in 4 to 5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the jamuns until they turn golden brown.
        Using a slotted spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes
        for each batch. Do not rush the frying process!
        When the jamuns are golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.</p>
    <h4>step 6</h4>
    <p>Let each jamun sit for 45 to 60 seconds, and then add the fried jamuns to the warm sugar syrup.
        Repeat with the next batch of jamuns, frying them and then adding them to the sugar syrup. Let the jamuns soak
        in the sugar syrup for at least 2 hours. Overnight soaking is fine, too.</p>

    <img src="./pudding.jpeg" alt="pudding" width="200" height="200">
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method of preparation:</h3>
    <h4>step 1</h4>
    <p>Heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until bubbles form at the edges.</p>
    <h4>step 2</h4>
    <p>Mix sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a small bowl.</p>
    <h4>step 3</h4>
    <p>Add sugar, cornstarch, and salt mixture to hot milk, a little at a time, stirring until thick enough to coat the
        back of the spoon.</p>
    <h4>step 4</h4>
    <p>Remove saucepan from heat, and stir in vanilla and butter.</p>
    <h4>step 5</h4>
    <p>Spoon pudding evenly into 5 serving dishes. For best results, chill pudding in the refrigerator before serving.
